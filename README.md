# A Beginner's Guide of the Loss Development Triangle with Python Code Calculation

## Introduction
A Loss Development Triangle is a method used by actuaries to analyze how claims mature and develop over time. It is structured as a triangular array of data, where each row represents a cohort (usually based on the year of claim occurrence or underwriting year), and each column represents a development period (such as months or years since the claim occurred). This structure allows actuaries to observe how claims for a particular cohort develop, increase, or decrease as time passes.

The primary purpose of the Loss Development Triangle is to provide insights into patterns and trends in claim development, which in turn helps in estimating future claims liabilities. Actuaries use them to estimate the reserve needed for unpaid claims, ensuring that insurance companies maintain financial stability and comply with regulatory requirements.
